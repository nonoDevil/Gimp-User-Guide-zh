Gimp、CUPS（译者注：Common Unix Printing System，通用Unix打印管理系统）和Gutenprint在帮您完成高质量相片的过程中是合作关系。——Michael J Hamel 在他的制图系列教程中继续说道。





Ever since the birth of Gnome and KDE, printing support has
been the bane of the Linux office desktop user. Advances in
2D and 3D graphics have been phenomenal thanks to the
requirements of the special effects industry in Hollywood, yet
with high-quality futuristic displays at our doorstep, we still settle
for Stone Age prints. Until recently, the lack of a unified printing
system has meant that desktop applications have either
implemented their own printing features or relied on the lowest
common denominators, often leading to low-quality prints or, even
worse, no facility for printing at all. Even when we started to
acquire good quality printer drivers and the necessary tools to use
them on the desktop, colour management in Linux applications
has been essentially non-existent.

自Gnome和KDE诞生以来，打印支持就成了使用Linux桌面版办公的用户的痛苦根源。由于好莱坞对特效工业的需求，2D和3D制图学的进展十分迅猛。然而，哪怕我们家中就摆放着高质量的、充满未来感的显示设备，我们还是只满足于石器时代的照片。直到最近，对统一打印系统的缺少意味着桌面应用要么得实现他们自己的打印特性，要么得依赖于最低端普遍的共同特性，这样常常导致了制作出低质量的照片，或者更差的是，根本没有适用于他们打印系统的设备。虽然我们开始寻求高质量的打印驱动和必要的工具来用于桌面，但色彩管理在Linux应用里基本上不存在。

Fortunately, that’s started to change in a big way. The Linux
printing scene has seen a wealth of printer driver support from
both open source and commercial providers. As a result, the
under-the-hood printing system has evolved into a system of
libraries and utilities that desktop systems such as Gnome and
KDE can harness – all tied together through the magic of CUPS.

幸运的是，这样的窘境开始以一种了不起的方式改变了。Linux打印场景（？）看到了从开源提供商和商业提供商中有关打印机驱动支持的大量资源。结果就是，底层的打印系统发展出了一种由函数库和公用程式组成的系统，这种系统能被像Gnome和KDE这样的桌面系统轻松驾驭——与CUPS的魔法结合起来后。


Drivers, spoolers, filters and printers

驱动、后台打印程序、滤镜和打印机


Before we dive into how to use all of this with Gimp, it’s important
to have a basic understanding of how printing works under Linux.
Printers come in two forms: PostScript and non-PostScript.
PostScript is a device-independent language that describes the
data to be printed. PostScript-capable printers can understand 
this language directly, whereas non-compatible printers must have
data converted into a custom printer language. Getting files into
PostScript in the first place is a multi-step process that involves a
series of software packages.


在我们一头钻进去研究如何利用Gimp使用这些东西的时候，对打印在Linux下的工作原理有个基本了解还是很有必要的。打印机有两种形式：PostScript 打印机和non-PonstScript打印机。PostScript是为以相对设备独立的方式描述影像提供一种方便的语言。支持PostScript的打印机就能直接理解这种语言，反之，不兼容此语言的打印机就必须将数据转化成一种特别制定的打印机语言。将文件用PostScript语言封装是一个需要一系列软件的多布式封装过程。

The Linux printing environment is made up of four levels of
software: drivers, spoolers, filters and applications. Printer drivers
form the backbone of printing; they send data to the printer using
a language the printer will understand. Some Epson printers, for
example, use a language called ESC/P while other manufacturers
use a language called PCL. The data must already be in that
language when the driver receives it, however; the drivers are not
responsible for doing any data conversions.


Linux的打印环境有四个不同等级的软件组成：驱动程序、后台打印程序、滤镜和应用。驱动程序是打印的脊柱，它们用一种打印机能理解的语言将数据输送给打印机。比如说，有些爱普生（译者注：Epson，一种日本打印机品牌）打印机用一种叫ESC/P的语言，而其他制造商用一种叫PCL的语言。当驱动程序接受数据时，数据必须以那种指定语言的形式存在，否则驱动就不能做出任何回应以进行待打印数据的转换。


CUPS and Gutenprint


CUPS和Gutenprint

Printer drivers for Linux come primarily from the Gutenprint
and/or Ghostscript projects, although HP have their own set of
drivers (known as the HPIJS) that they actively support. Other
vendors, including Epson, offer drivers for their printers as well. All
of the drivers are intended to be fed data to print via the various
Linux print spoolers.


Linux的打印机驱动主要是来自Gutenprint和Ghostscript项目，虽然惠普有他们为自己提供的驱动（像HPIJS），其他厂商，包括爱普生，也为他们自己的打印机提供驱动。所有的这些驱动都是为了将数据输入Linux的后台打印程序来完成打印。


Drivers are at the bottom of this four-layer software stack for
printing. At the opposite end are applications, with spoolers just
below. When an application is directed to print a file, it sends it to a
print spooler, which queues it up to be processed later (when the
spooler is not busy with other print jobs). There are many spoolers
available for Linux, including LPR (Line Printer Remote), LPRng
and CUPS (Common Unix Printing System). CUPS is becoming
the standard for spoolers on Linux distributions for a variety of
reasons, although none of these make much difference to end
users. It’s important to note that you’ll be working with CUPS to
set up your printers.


驱动在打印工作所需的四层顺序的软件里时位于最下层的。相对而言，应用程序是位于最高位置的，后台打印程序位于中间。当一个应用程序被指使要打印一个文件时，它将文件传送给后台打印程序，后台打印程序将这个任务入队列准备打印（如果此时后台打印程序没有其他打印任务）。可用于Linux的后台打印程序有很多，包括LPR（译者注：Line Printer Remote，行式打印机远程控制），LPRng和CUPS（通用Unix打印管理系统）。由于各种各样的原因，CUPS成为了不同Linux发行版中后台打印程序的标准，虽然对终端用户来说这些Linux发行版没有什么区别，但意识到你使用的是CUPS来设置你的打印机是很重要的。

Once a spooler has a file queued for printing, it runs the file
through one or more filters that convert it into various formats.
The filtering process is better know as a ‘RIP’ (Raster Image
Processing). In some cases the files need to be converted into
PostScript first, then into a printer-specific format before being
sent to the printer driver. In other cases the file may already be in
PostScript format, or may not need to be converted to another
form before being sent to the printer driver.


一旦一个后台打印程序的打印队列里有一个任务时，计算机还会运行一个或更多的滤镜来将文件转化成各种各样的格式。这个过滤的过程应该被称为RIP（译者注：Raster Image
Processing，光栅图像处理）。在某些情况下，文件需要先被转化为PostScript格式的，然后，在被传送给打印机驱动前，还要转化为一种打印机指定的格式。在其他情况下，文件可能是PostScript格式的，并且在传送给打印机驱动前不许要被转化为其他格式。


Filters can come from a number of software packages. The
most widely used set of filters come from the Foomatic package,
but you won’t need to worry about them much because you’ll get
the ones you need when you install CUPS.


滤镜可以从很多软件包中获得。用得最多的一种滤镜是Foomatic，但是你完全没必要为如何获得一个滤镜操心太多，因为当你安装CUPS时你就获得了滤镜。


With all that software ready and under the hood, it’s time to
configure your printer. As well as checking the OpenPrinting
website (www.linuxfoundation.org/openprinting) to see if the
printer is supported, you’ll also want to install CUPS. CUPS is both
a spooler and a configuration tool. It allows you to configure your
printers whether they’re directly connected to your system, located
on your local network or connected to another system elsewhere
on your network. There’s a web-based config tool available, along
with desktop-specific tools for both Gnome and KDE.


在所有软件都在后台准备就绪时，是时候来配置你的打印机了。并且，你还需要检查一下OpenPrinting（译者注：一个Linux基金会）网站（www.linuxfoundation.org/openprinting）来看看你的打印机是否被此基金会的项目所支持。你应该还会想安装一下CUPS。CUPS是一个后台打印程序也是一个配置工具，它能帮你来检查你的打印机是否直接被连接到你的系统上，是否连接到你当前局域网内，或是否连接到你当前局域网内的其他系统。有一个基于网页的设置工具可以用，另外还有Gnome和KDE这两种桌面都能用的桌面版工具。

）


CUPS uses one or more filters to rip data into a format that can
be used by a printer driver. This spooler package is designed to
hide the filtering process, so users don’t have to know whether
a particular file is being converted before printing. All you need
to know is what printer model you have and how it’ll be connected
to your system.


CUPS用一或多种滤镜来把数据过滤成一种能被打印机驱动使用的文字。后台打印程序就是被设计成将过滤过程隐藏起来，所以用户没必要知道某个文件在打印之前正在被转换格式。你所需要了解的就只有你的打印机型号，还有怎么将打印机跟你的系统连接起来。


CUPS also uses PPD (PostScript Printer Description) files,
which describe the features of printers to applications that need to
use them. Despite the name, these files are used for describing
both PostScript and non-PostScript printers. Again, in most cases
you won’t need to acquire these files if CUPS and Gutenprint
support the printer.


CUPS也会使用PPD文件（译者注：PostScript Printer Description files，Postscript打印机描述文件。它为一台特定的Postscript打印机描述标准字型，纸张大小，分辨率和其他的能力的文件。一个打印机驱动器程序使用一个PPD文件以了解指定的打印机的能力。）虽然名字叫PostScript打印机描述文件，但这些文件既能用于描述PostScript打印机也能用于描述non-PostScript打印机。再说一遍，在大多数情况下，一旦CUPS和Gutenprint支持你的打印机，你就不需要操心后台打印程序的工作。


Gutenprint includes drivers for a huge number of printers.
However, because the package is under constant development,
the version of Gutenprint on your Linux distribution may not be up
to date. Fortunately, the version available from the OpenPrinting
website is always matched against its database of supported
printers, so if the database says the printer is supported but your
version of Gutenprint doesn’t have it, simply replace it with the
new version from the OpenPrinting site.


Gutenprint包含很多种打印机的驱动。然而，由于该软件一直处在不断开发中，你的Linux发行版里的Gutenprint也许不一定是最新版的。幸运的是，如果你的打印机被OpenPrinting数据库表明为支持、但你的Gutenprint版本又不是最新的话，你就可以登录OpenPrinting网站来更新到最新的版本。


Colour management


色彩管理


Colour management is the process of matching colours between
input devices (such as scanners and cameras), editing tools (such
as Gimp) and output devices (such as your monitor or printer).
Each input or output device has a range of colours it can work
with, but you can usually edit a wider range with your applications.
The goal of colour management software is to map colours from
the input and editing phases to the range of colours that can be
displayed on the output device in order to help assure the result is
visually identical to the source.


色彩管理是一个在输入设备（比如扫描仪和照相机）、编辑工具（比如Gimp）和输出设备（比如你的显示器或打印机）之间匹配颜色的过程。每个输入和输出设备都有一套它自己工作的颜色，但你通常也可以利用你的应用程序在更多颜色上编辑。色彩管理软件的工作就是在你将源文件输入和编辑后，用它的那一系列颜色着色好，最后能保证输出的样子跟源文件在视觉上基本符合。


Under Linux, colour management in applications is primarily
handled through a package known as LittleCMS. This is another of
those packages you don’t need to worry about, because your
application will install it if it needs it. Applications use LittleCMS in
conjunction with ICC colour profiles, which are files describing the
colour capabilities of a particular device, sometimes under specific
conditions. For example, most cameras have their ICC profiles
embedded in the images they take. This is why you sometimes see
a message pop up in Gimp, telling you the image is in a certain
colour space and asking if you want to convert it to a different
one. Printers, on the other hand, often deliver their profiles via
setup disks and usually provide one profile for each of the different
types of paper they can print on to.


在Linux下，应用商店里的色彩管理软件一般就是LittleCMS（译者注：一个小型的，精确高效的色彩管理引擎）。这又是一个你不需要操心太多的软件，因为你的应用程序在需要的时候会自动安装上这个引擎。应用程序将LittleCMS和ICC颜色配置文件结合起来用，ICC颜色配置文件就是在某些特殊情况下用于描述指定设备的色彩性能的文件。例如，大多数相机在摄像时都会在照片数据里内嵌ICC颜色配置文件。这就是为什么有时候你用Gimp要编辑一张照片时，它会弹出提示告诉你该照片处于某种特定的色彩空间，你要不要把它转换成另外一种色彩空间。另一方面，打印机也会自己通过安装盘传递配置文件，并且通常给它能在上面打印的每一张、不同类型的纸都提供统一的配置文件。


For printers under Linux, you may run into problems trying to
find the ICC profile files on the hardware’s setup disc. In my case, I
was able to find the profiles for my new Epson Stylus Photo R280
buried in CAB archive files on the disc. You need to install the
Cabextract utility to unpack these files. Do this by copying the CAB
file to a directory and running:
cabextract filename.CAB


对于Linux下的打印机，你可能会在从硬件安装盘中寻找ICC配置文件时遇到问题。就我的情况来说，当我要配置我新买的Epson Stylus Photo R280打印机时，我发现ICC配置文件藏在安装盘的一个CAB归档文件里。你需要安装Cabextract（译者注：是个自由软件，用于解包微软的 .cab 压缩文件。它可以运行在UNIX、Linux、Mac OS X、minix 等等系统上。）来解压这些文件。然后，让我们将CAB文件复制到一个目录，并运行命令：
cabextract filename.CAB




(以下为图片旁带>的注释小字：

For my Epson
R280, there were
two CAB files that
contained identical
binary ICM files. I
unpacked one CAB
file and saved only
the ICM files.


就我的Epson R280打印机来说，有两个CAB压缩包里包含了相同的二进制ICM文件，所以我就解压了一个CAB包并把那些ICM文件保存了下来。
）


I ran the file command on all files extracted from the archive
and found that the ICM files were ICC colour profiles. I copied
these to a directory where I can keep them safe (with my
backups). I found multiple profiles and had to open them in Gimp
to identify their purpose, which turned out to be one profile for
each type of paper the printer supported.


我将那些从压缩包解压出来的文件都打开运行了一遍，最后发现那些ICM文件就是我要找的ICC颜色配置文件。我把它们都复制到一个稳定安全的目录中（和我的备份们一起）。我发现这些配置文件有很多，所以我就都在Gimp中打开了它们以确认它们各自的用途，最后发现它们分别是此台打印机支持的每一种纸张的配置文件。






Install LPROF


安装LPROF（译者注：LPROF 是一个用于创建设备兼容，如相机、扫描仪、显示器的ICC兼容型材的颜色分析器。这些配置提供跨设备的色彩一致性。他们可以用在颜色配置文件识别软件，如GIMP与Scribus。）





Once you have your printer configured, have the printer ICC profile
files to hand and prepare to use colour management under Linux.
We’re not quite ready to do that yet because we don’t have an ICC
monitor profile, so first we need to create one. We can do that
easily using LPROF, but that package isn’t available for all
distributions and requires a lot of effort to compile for those it
doesn’t support. This section is for those who have problems
compiling LPROF on their systems. For those users with a
distribution that already has LPROF, such as Ubuntu, skip to the
next section to see how to use it.


一旦你完成了打印机的配置，你一定准备着手处理ICC配置文件以用于Linux下的色彩管理。但是我们还差几个步骤，因为我们还没有一个ICC显示器配置文件，所以我们首先要创造一个。我们可以用LPROF简单地做到，但LPROF不是支持所有的Linux发行版，而且，对于那些它不支持的发行版还需要很麻烦地编译。接下来这个小节是为那些在他们系统中编译LPROF遇到困难的用户写的。如果你的Linux发行版已经有了LPROF（比如Ubuntu），那就跳过这段直接看下一段如何使用。


First, download a copy of the latest version of LPROF from
http://lprof.sourceforge.net. I’m working with version 1.11.4.
This version has multiple requirements, the most important of
which are:
Qt 3
Vigra
LittleCMS v1.16


首先，从http://lprof.sourceforge.net下载一份最新版本的LPROF。我现在用的版本是1.11.4 。这个版本的使用有一些必要条件，其中最重要的是：

Tutorial Gimp


The latest versions of most Linux distributions are likely to
default to Qt 4, but they probably also have Qt 3 available to install
manually. On Fedora 9, I ran the following to get it:
sudo yum -y install qt3 qt3-devel
Vigra, (Vision with Genetic Algorithms) is a computer vision
library. I installed both the runtime and development libraries for
this package:
sudo yum -y install vigra vigra-devel


The most troublesome package of the three will be LittleCMS
(www.littlecms.com), the latest version of which is 1.17. You can’t
install the prepackaged 1.16 into system directories in parallel with
newest version, so you need to download the source code for
v1.16, compile it and install in a separate directory. When I run into
issues like this, I install the specialised package under /usr/
local/<packagename>. I run whichever tools require this
package with a shell script to make sure that the package is found
before others with similar names or updated versions are found in
the normal system directories.


Again, be sure you’ve downloaded the source for version 1.16.
To compile LittleCMS and install it under its own directory under
/usr/local, I run the following commands:
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/lcms
make
sudo make install
With the prerequisites installed I can now compile LPROF and
install it under its own directory under /usr/local:
export PATH=/usr/local/lcms/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lcms/lib:$LD_
LIBRARY_PATH
python scons.py cxxflags=”-I/usr/local/lcms/include”
PREFIX=/usr/local/lprof
sudo python scons.py install


Management with LPROF


To run LPROF, I use this simple script:
#!/bin/bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lcms/lib:$LD_
LIBRARY_PATH
export PATH=/usr/local/lprof/bin:$PATH
lprof


LPROF enables you to create ICC profiles for scanners,
cameras and monitors. You need to use specialised hardware to
get highly accurate profiles, but we can get a rough estimate for a
monitor just using LPROF.

You can make a coarse approximation of a monitor profile just
using your eyes. To begin, you should be in a dark room with the
monitor’s contrast control set to its highest level. If you can’t be in
a completely dark room, try placing a dark-coloured cloth over the
monitor and your head while you’re doing this. You might look a
little silly, but you’ll get better results. Don’t leave the cloth over
the monitor (especially a CRT monitor) for very long because it
may overheat.


The printing ecosystem


Find out if your printer is supported, get the latest news
and learn more about printing under Linux by visiting the
OpenPrinting section at the Linux Foundation’s website:
www.linuxfoundation.org/en/OpenPrinting.



Coarse approximations


The process of creating a coarse approximation profile is
explained on the Monitor page of the LPROF documentation
(http://lprof.sourceforge.net/help/monitor.html), but this
page is a little hard to follow, so I’ll walk you through the process.
The LPROF window opens with a set of tabs on the right. In the
Monitor Profile tab you’ll see that the first option under Profile
Method is to create a coarse profile. Click the Enter Monitor Values
button to open the Monitor Values dialog. Click the Set Gamma
And Black Point button under the Gamma entry. The window that
opens has a small window labelled ‘Gamma = 2.2’ and a larger
window to the right that’s labelled ‘Gamma And Black Level’ You’ll
.
see a slider at the the bottom, along with some other buttons.


Adjust the slider so that the Gamma = 2.2 window shows the
horizontal lines and the box around them as close to a solid grey
as you can make them. The lines probably won’t go away when
you do this; the trick is to stare at the box so your vision goes
slightly out of focus and make sure that the grey gradient you see
is as smooth as possible. This adjustment sets the gamma level
for your monitor. Your monitor profile tells software to adjust
images so they display as if your monitor were at 2.2.


After setting the gamma level, you need to adjust the
Brightness control of your monitor, which may also be labelled
‘Black Point’ (as it is on my Westinghouse LCD monitor). Adjust it
so that the bars in the Black Level window on the right are barely
visible across from 2.2 on the scale just to the left and disappear
completely from view by 1.9. After making the Brightness or Black
Point adjustment on your monitor, you may need to adjust the
Gamma slider again. Repeat this process a few times until you’re
satisfied with the result.


You may need to click the Link Channels button to adjust the
Red, Green and Blue channels separately. With each channel, try
to adjust the gamma first, then adjust the Brightness on the
monitor. Close the window by clicking on the OK button and then
close the Rough Monitor Values window.


Create a new profile



Back in the LPROF main window, you’ll see the Profile
Identification button in the top-left. Click on this to fill in the
monitor make and model information, which is often found on a
label on the back of the monitor.


At the bottom-right of the LPROF window, just above the
Create Profile button is the Output Profile field. Type in the path
and name of the ICC output file, then click on Create Profile. You
can check the profile using the Profile Checker button. Information
on how to use this is found on the Profile Checker page of the
LPROF documentation.

Gimp Tutorial

(以下为图片旁带>的注释小字：

Use the Gamma/Black Point window to visually configure
your monitor profile without specialised hardware.
）


Using profiles is very straightforward, but interpreting the
results and adjusting an image accordingly takes some
experimentation. Gimp 2.4 introduced support for ICC profiles in
the Colour Management page of the Preferences dialog. This is
where you select the profiles for your printer and the monitor
profile that we just created with LPROF.


The Mode of Operation controls how you will view your images
in the Canvas window. Setting this to Colour Managed Display
will cause Gimp to display images using your monitor profile
(which we’ll configure in a moment), while setting it to Print
Simulation will cause Gimp to display the image using the printer
profile. This is what you want to use when you want to preview
your image to check for out-of-gamut colours. These are colours
that can’t be reproduced by your printer given the printer profile
you’ll be using. The purpose of the RGB and CMYK settings isn’t
clear from Gimp documentation, but for now you can leave these
set to None.


Interpreting profiles


Use the Monitor Profile setting to select the profile you created
using LPROF. The Print Simulation profile is used to select the
profile for your printer. Notice that I have multiple profiles and the
Gimp dialog for selecting the profile provides information about
the profile. For my Epson printer, I have profiles set up for different
papers, most of which were created using a White Point setting of
5000K (which is shown here as D50).


Gimp has multiple methods available for interpreting profiles.
These can be set with the Display Rendering Intent (for
interpreting how images are shown on the Canvas) and Softproof
Rendering Intent (for how printed images will be previewed on the
Canvas) options in the Preferences dialog. The various options
available are quite technical and the Perceptual option is probably
the best for most home and small business use. Professional
designers can read the Gimp help documentation for details on
the other options.


The File Open Behaviour option determines what Gimp will do
with images it opens that have ICC profile data embedded in them.
Cameras often embed profiles in the images they create. There’s
little reason not to set this to Convert To RGB Workspace; leaving it
as ‘Ask What To Do’ will cause a prompt to be displayed asking you
what to do when you open images with embedded profiles.


The most important option in the Preferences is the Mark Out
Of Gamut setting. With this option enabled, and the Mode of
Operation set to Print Simulation, the Gimp Canvas window will
highlight any pixels that won’t print properly with a specified
colour (which defaults to grey). This enables you to see which
pixels will have to be converted to another colour by the printer. It
will, in effect, tell you how different your image is likely to be from
what you see when you’re working on the image on screen.


With out-of-gamut colours marked, you may wonder how you
can fix an image to print properly (without having the printer
convert them to different colours). Unfortunately, there is no fix-all
option. For my images, I adjusted the different Colour Channels in
the Curves dialog by moving the end points of the graph away from
the corners. When you do this with Preview enabled in the Curves
dialog you can watch the grey, out-of-gamut colours change. In this
case, the fix took only a few seconds, but you may find that the
Curves dialog is not sufficient for your needs. In that case, you’ll
need to experiment with other tools in the Colour menu.


Printing


With your image colour corrected you’re ready to print. Remember
we used CUPS and Gutenprint to set up our printer. Gimp has its
own print dialog built into it. Gutenprint also provides a separate
print plugin for use with Gimp. With both enabled, you can choose
which is more appropriate for your needs.


Gimp’s built-in Print window offers a print preview, but it
doesn’t make clear whether the preview is colour-adjusted based
on ICC profiles. Still, for most home printing, you’ll probably be
happy with the preview it provides.


Gutenprint’s Print window offers much finer control over the
print process itself. The print preview is purposely very low quality
to make it easier to drag it around the page for alignment. This
preview does not make use of your printer’s ICC profiles. What’s
most important about the Gutenprint dialog is that you can
configure any printer you might have connected to your computer
for use with Gimp, even if that computer isn’t configured through
CUPS. This is useful, for example, if you have a printer used
specifically for Gimp prints, but not shared with others in your
household or business.


Summary


Printing support under Linux has become easily good enough for
the home and small business user due to advances in Gutenprint,
CUPS and the availability of drivers from commercial printer
vendors. Colour management under
Gimp is still a work in progress, but the 2.4
release has brought us closer to colour
Nirvana with the ability to work directly
convert images from their original colour

Unless you’re a graphic designer working
with a client who has specific colour
requirements, you probably won’t worry
much about colour management and ICC
profiles when using Gimp. If you don’t care
about such things, it won’t matter if you
convert images from their original colour space.
 If you do care, you should convert the image 
before working on it. Be certain to save your work into a 
different file so you can maintain the colour profile 
information in the original file.

Next month We’ll use quick colour fixes to adjust tints and whiten a smile.
